And nothing kicks off a memorable Life Day quite so much as watching the legendary Star Wars Holiday Special receive a fully deserved Rifftrax parody treatment! Yes, all your favorite Wookies are here: there's Chewbacca, Malla, Itchy, Lumpy and Art Carney. Tony Award Winner and Oscar nominated Diahann Carroll as a singing holographic prostitute who services Grandpa Itchy. And Bea Arthur stretches her talent by playing a woman. Not only that, there are commercials from 1978 that will come close to convincing you that \"1978\" is fairly synonymous with \"Hell\". Because we taped ours off of the television set, and our NV-9300 doesn't have an \"edit\" function printed on one of its dozens of plastic piano key-style switches, we just left the commercials in there. Bill, Mike, and Kevin make this the itchiest, lumpiest Life Day of them all!","poster_path":"/sA17V2ea1oxBfuaMP0xd7y7Yu77.jpg","media_type":"movie","adult":false,"title":"RiffTrax: The Star Wars Holiday Special","original_language":"en","genre_ids":[35],"popularity":0.878,"release_date":"2007-12-07","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1},{"backdrop_path":null,"id":340023,"original_title":"Mad Max: The Wasteland","overview":"Follow Max Rockatansky in the year before the events of \"Mad Max: Fury Road.\"","poster_path":null,"media_type":"movie","adult":false,"title":"Mad Max: The Wasteland","original_language":"en","genre_ids":[28,12,878],"popularity":18.349,"release_date":"","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"backdrop_path":"/6YO8KUBFuH2fReUrAFmASoqQPjj.jpg","id":1108828,"original_title":"Girls Will Be Girls","overview":"In a strict boarding school nestled in the Himalayas, 16-year-old Mira discovers desire and romance.
