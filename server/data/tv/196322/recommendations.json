Each episode was a dramatisation of a science fiction short story. Some were written directly for the series, but most were adaptations of already published stories.\n\nThe first three years were exclusively science fiction, but that genre was abandoned in the final year in favour of horror/fantasy stories. A number of episodes were wiped during the early 1970s, as was standard procedure at the time. A large number of episodes are still missing but some do turn up from time to time; for instance, Level Seven from series two, originally broadcast on 27 October 1966 was returned to the BBC from the archives of a European broadcaster in January 2006.","poster_path":"/n8o2KS8D49ZcQ4NbVJ1K2ROaBjm.jpg","media_type":"tv","adult":false,"name":"Out of the Unknown","original_language":"en","genre_ids":[10765,18],"popularity":9.601,"first_air_date":"1965-10-04","vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"origin_country":["GB"]},{"backdrop_path":"/rFScL1dBIlEEkGzL1ezs6rvWXgA.jpg","id":253392,"original_name":"The Fortune Hotel","overview":"Ten pairs of contestants arrive at a Caribbean resort filled with glamour, opulence and deception.
