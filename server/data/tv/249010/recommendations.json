Officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the USSR was a one-party state, governed, controlled, and tormented by a single party rule. That of the Communist Party. Complicated, contradictory figureheads would come and go, men who held this impossible country it seemed by sheer will. Stalin the despot-hero whose cruelty knew few bounds who united a nation to defeat Hitler. Khrushchev the crafty libertarian, who preached reform yet allowed an arms race to escalate. Brezhnev, that unreadable member to the old guard, sending history backwards. And of course Gorbachev, who brought vast change, modernisation, and détente, yet saw the Soviet Union collapse under his rule – the untenable nation. The 20th century was shaped by its convulsions, its purges, its wars, and its leaders.","poster_path":"/adIFhqlwrtEXp4VmBnvPCkPQIjx.jpg","media_type":"tv","adult":false,"name":"The Soviet Union: 100th Anniversary 1922","original_language":"en","genre_ids":[99],"popularity":1.064,"first_air_date":"2022-01-01","vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2,"origin_country":["GB"]},{"backdrop_path":"/1HZePrpAqsbhqpQL1Iy2CY06o9R.jpg","id":126300,"original_name":"Kazara Aşk","overview":"","poster_path":"/zUgXTbQiVoeWELxEeFWd4sWTHMo.jpg","media_type":"tv","adult":false,"name":"Kazara Aşk","original_language":"tr","genre_ids":[18,35],"popularity":5.204,"first_air_date":"2021-06-24","vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":10,"origin_country":["TR"]},{"backdrop_path":"/qUZU1mcSJrMSirPv74RNJTs3xFV.jpg","id":44641,"original_name":"This Is England '90","overview":"Shaun, Harvey, Gadget, Trev and Kelly hit up the nightlife of raves and ecstasy.
